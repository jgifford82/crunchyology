        <p class="about">Crunchyology was born out of one of those classic
            pregnancy
            cravings—you know, the kind that makes zero sense
            where nothing was going to stand between you and that perfect bite. I had to have something crunchy and
            flavorful. Nothing store-bought was cutting it, so I rolled up my sleeves, raided the pantry, and started
            making granola in my kitchen.
            <br><br>
            Turns out, I didn't just satisfy the craving—I fell in love with the whole process. The mixing, the baking,
            the way the house smelled like toasted oats and magic. I started handing out jars to friends (hello, best
            edible gift ever). And my boys? They couldn't get enough of it. Watching them devour something I made from
            scratch was the best feeling.
            <br><br>
            Fast forward four years, and here we are—Crunchyology is officially out in the wild. I'm now selling my
            granola at the farmers market and from home, made the same way it started: by hand, in small batches, with
            high-quality ingredients and zero fillers. The oats are certified organic and gluten-free. It's the real
            scrumptious deal.
            <br><br>
            Crunchyology is all about that perfect bite: wholesome, delicious, and just a little bit addicting. Made
            with love, a dash of chaos, and a whole lot of crunch.
